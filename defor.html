      <p> <u> Deforestation</u> is defined by Britannica as "the clearing or thinning of forests by humans”. In some cases, all the trees in an area are removed, completely destroying the forest. This is called clear-cutting. The main causes for deforestation -- food, firewood, mineral extraction, unsustainable agricultural expansion -- continue growing across the globe.
      </p>
      <p> Some major forest threats include <b>agriculture/farming</b>, <b>illegal logging</b>, <b>mining</b>, and <b>road construction</b>. Forestry practices, wildfires and, in small part, urbanization account for a large portion of deforestation.
      </p>
      <p> Logging operations, for the world’s wood and paper products, destroy countless trees each year. Loggers, some of them acting illegally, also build roads to access more and more remote forests—which leads to further deforestation. Forests are also cut as a result of growing urban sprawl as land is developed for homes.
      </p>
      <p> In some cases, even partial logging and accidental fires thin out the trees enough to change the forest structure dramatically.

      <p><b>Interesting Facts:</b></p>
      <ol style="margin-top:-10px">
        <li> Forest products account for about 1 percent of the world’s gross domestic product, and the total global market for commercial wood products — including logs, lumber, panels, pulp and paper — is more than US$ 200 billion per year.​
        </li>
        <li> More than 1 billion rural people depend on forests to some extent, and over 90 percent of people living in extreme poverty depend on forests for all or part of their livelihoods.
        </li>
        <li> Despite their immense value, since the 1960s, nearly half of the world’s rainforests have been lost. Every day, about 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) of rainforest — an area nearly 14 times the size of Manhattan — are burned around the world.​
        </li>
        <li> About 36 football fields’ worth of trees are lost every minute due to deforestation.​
        </li>
        <li> When forests are cleared, they emit carbon dioxide. Eleven percent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans can be blamed on deforestation — equivalent to the emissions from all the cars and trucks on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>  A more sustainable alternative is using existing farmland more efficiently, rather than clear more forests to grow food.​
        </li>
        <li> Forests are vital for food and water — and they affect you, whether you know it or not.
        </li>
