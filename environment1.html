      <p>  The National Geographic society defines climate change as the long-term alteration of temperature and normal weather patterns in a place. For example: a tropical climate area such as Florida, which is known for its warm and humid climate were to start experiencing snow storms every winter then we could safely assume that climate change has caused this drastic change. Climate change does not happen overnight; however, we notice its effects once the tiny changes have accumulated which is why it may seem cliamte change appeared overnight to prits wheb we see the accumulation of the slight changes that we understand the effects. A slight rise in degree from the prior may not seem like much but can actually cause some damaging effects. Although climate change is to some degree a natural process for example during the ice age the earths climate warmed up. The rate at which it is happening today is unprecedented because of the huge amount humans have contribted to climate change. </p>

    <div style="margin: -40px -40px 0 0;"> <p> Humans contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; these gases have an ability to trap heat in the earth's atmosphere. Humans emit most greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels in cars, buildings, factories and power plants. According to National Geographic, carbon dioxide (C02) is the gas responsible for the most warming. When gases that trap heat are released in the atmosphere it's called the greenhouse effect; the more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the warmer the earth. This is what global warming is referring to, the warming of the Earth. Climate change refers to the effects of the Earth heating up.</p>

    <p><b> Caption:</b> On the left are the Coral Reefs in Dibba, located on the east coast of the northern Emirates, in 2004. On the right are the Reefs in 2008. The reefs were devastated in 2008 by algae blooms known as red tide, potentially linked to inceased greenhouse gases and rising  ocean temperatures. The red tide kills sea life by depleting the oxygen in the water. </p>

    <p> <b> Caption:</b> Levels of Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are higher than they have been at any time in the past 400,000 years. In 2013, CO2 levels surpassed 400ppm for the first time in recorded history. This recent rise in CO2 shows a remarkably constant relationship with fossil-fuel burning,  and be well accounted for because about 60% of fossil fuel emissions stay in the air. </p>
    <p> Climate change is real. Whether you believe it or not it is happening all around us. According to National Geographic the heat record set in 2016 had broken the heat record set in 2015 which had broken the record set in 2014. Additionally, Earth's temperature is now 1.69 degrees Farenheit warmer than the 20th century national average. Higher temperatures cause Earth's glaciers to melt which contribute to the rise in sea levels. Sea levels are expected to rise three feet by the year 2100. Instead of heat being reflected by the glaciers back into the sky it will be absorbed by the darker colored ocean, further warming the Earth. Climate change makes natural disasters more prevalent or worse. For instance, in dry regions drought periods may occur more frequently as a result of climate change. The Paris heat waves in 2018 should have been a once in 500 years event but because of climate change it is now a one in 40 years.
