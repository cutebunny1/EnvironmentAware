      <p>  The national geographic society defines climate change as the long-term alteration of temperature and normal weather patterns in a place. For example, a tropical climate area such as Florida which is known for its warm, humid climate were start to experiencing snow storms every winter we could safely assume that the climate change plays a part in this drastic change. however climate change doesnâ€™t happen overnight, its wheb we see the accumulation of the slight changes that we understand the effects. A slight rise in degree from the prior may not seem like much but can actually cause some damaging effects. Although climate change is to some degree a natural process for example during the ice age the earths climate warmed up. The rate at which it is happening today is unprecedented because of the huge amount humans have contribted to climate change. </p>
