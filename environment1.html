      <p>  The national geographic society defines climate change as the long-term alteration of temperature and normal weather patterns in a place. For example, a tropical climate area such as Florida which is known for its warm, humid climate were start to experiencing snow storms every winter we could safely assume that the climate change plays a part in this drastic change. however climate change doesn’t happen overnight, its wheb we see the accumulation of the slight changes that we understand the effects. A slight rise in degree from the prior may not seem like much but can actually cause some damaging effects. Although climate change is to some degree a natural process for example during the ice age the earths climate warmed up. The rate at which it is happening today is unprecedented because of the huge amount humans have contribted to climate change. Big buissness such as the textile industry contribute tons of pollution into both the air and ocean, humans create tons of non decomposable waste like styrofoam which gets tossed into oceans and landfills where it stays for decades. All of these negative habits contribute to global warming which is a change in earths tenoerature due to a higher pollution which tears the ozone layer which blocks the sun’s rays causing the earth to warm up more. global warming affects climate change because the rise in tenperature brings a change in weather. With climate change comes a host of problems such as drought, flooding, forest fires and other natural disasters. This can cause people to starve, lose their homes or die of malnutrition thus creating climate refugees. Climate change is a serious problem and if humans don’t change their habits and reduce their carbon footprint now then earth will no longer be viable to be our home. head over to the hoe you can help page to see ways you can help</p>
